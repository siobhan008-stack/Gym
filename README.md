![](assets/project/Mockups.docx)
You can find mockups and screenshots of the website in the assets/project directory.
Note: I purposely didn't keep a consisent design on the pool/gym/classes pages in an effort to show ability around different placings of text and images and responsive design.

4. jQuery - for navbar
5. Gitpod - IDE for project development
6. Github - version control & repository

Note: Testing was completed on the Chrome browser.

## Bugs:
There are some responsive display issues which I would like to fix but didn't have time.
Menus should all display correct pages however.

## Deployment:
- The website is hosted on Github Pages.
- To deploy this project, I went to github.com, logged in, and navigated to my repositories where I found my Gym project.
- When I clicked into the "Gym" project, and clicked on the Settings button, scrolled down to Github Pages, under Source I selected "master branch".
- The project then became available at the following link: https://siobhan008-stack.github.io/Gym/

## Difference between deployed and development versions:
Should not be any differences.

## Links to my project:

In the bottom pane in the terminal window where it shows /workspace/gym if the webserver isn't started you can start the web server by typing python3 -m http.server
At the prompt which appears, click "Make Public" and then "Open Browser", and the website will display in a new browser window.

## Media:
### Text:
The text for the website was copied largely from this website:
https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/.

### Images:
I used the logo from here: https://www.energiefitness.com/.
In an effort to try to get some gym images I googled images from the web and used them.
Other images were pulled from   https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/ and https://westwood.ie/.
Some of the images are copyrighted but were just used for the purposes of this project. 
For a live website no copyright images would be used.

## Acknowledgements:
- I received inspiration for this project from various gym websites.
- Credit due to my mentor Jonathan Munz for much coding inspiration, review and enhancement ideas for my website!
- Big thanks also to the tutors also for assistance during the project. 

Unfortunately I missed out on the slack channel #user-centric-frontend. I was just looking at the github channel so I think I missed out on a lot of general help. As a result I think my website is a lot more basic than it could be. However I feel if I don't submit now, I'm afraid I might not finish the course. I also spent a huge amount of time trying to make modifications for different screen sizes (note I have six pages). My issue was trying to understand how to view each bootstrap size. For eg. I would use Chrome's dev tools to view on an iPhone6 and that view would appear differently to my own iPhone6 hardware, and at what breakpoint to code and view each. And which one would the assessors would be looking at. This was not clear to me from the learning or project outline.
Tim finally explained this to me, however I had a lot of wasted time prior to this, on this.
