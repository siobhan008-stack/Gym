### Bugs:
There are some responsive display issues which I would like to fix but didn't have time.
The menu options could display better on a tablet.

## Deployment:
1. The website is hosted on Github Pages.
2. To deploy this project, I went to github.com, logged in and went to my repositories, where I found my Gym project.
3. When I clicked into the "Gym" project, and Clicked on the Settings button, scrolled down to Github Pages, under Source I selected master branch.
4. The project then became available at the following link: https://siobhan008-stack.github.io/Gym/

Note: Testing was completed on the Chrome browser.

I used the logo from here: https://www.energiefitness.com/
In an effort to try to get some matching green gym images I googled images from the web and used them.
Other images were pulled from   https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/ and https://westwood.ie/
=>Some of the images are copyrighted but I just used it for this project as it matched web. 
Obviously for a live website I would not use these images

2. Credit also to my mentor Jonathan Munz for much coding inspiration, review and enhancement ideas for my website.
3. Big thanks to the tutors also for assistance during the project and to Kevin as I had missed to include a script menu from one of my pages which was preventing the membership menu to function.

## Credits:
To the various websites I pulled my images from just for the purposes of the project

## Note:
Unfortunately I missed out on the slack channel user-centric-frontend. I was just looking at the github channel so I think I missed out on a lot of general help. As a result I think my website is a lot more basic than it could be. But if I don't submit now, I'm afraid I might not finish the course.
