Note: Testing was completed on the Chrome browser.

## Bugs:
There are some responsive display issues which I would like to fix but didn't have time.
Otherwise menus should display correct pages.

## Deployment:
1. The website is hosted on Github Pages.
2. To deploy this project, I went to github.com, logged in and went to my repositories, where I found my Gym project.
3. When I clicked into the "Gym" project, and Clicked on the Settings button, scrolled down to Github Pages, under Source I selected master branch.
4. The project then became available at the following link: https://siobhan008-stack.github.io/Gym/

## Difference between deployed and development versions:
Should not be any differences.

## Links to my project:
https://f98105b5-737a-482b-9ce4-885c9fe42297.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/
In the bottom pane in the terminal window where it shows /workspace/gym if the webserver isn't started you can start the web server by typing python3 -m http.server
At the prompt which appears, click "Make Public" and then Open Browser, and the website will display in a new browser window.

## MEDIA:
### Text:
The text for the website was copied largely from this website:
https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/

### Images:
I used the logo from here: https://www.energiefitness.com/
In an effort to try to get some matching green gym images I googled images from the web and used them.
Other images were pulled from   https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/ and https://westwood.ie/
=>Some of the images are copyrighted but I just used it for this project as it matched web. 
Obviously for a live website I would not use these images

## Acknowledgements:
- I received inspiration for this project from various gym websites.
- Credit due to my mentor Jonathan Munz for much coding inspiration, review and enhancement ideas for my website.
- Big thanks to the tutors also for assistance during the project and to Kevin as I had missed to include a script menu from one of my pages which was preventing the membership menu to function.
