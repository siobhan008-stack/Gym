BUGS:

DEPLOYMENT:
The website is hosted on Github Pages.
To publish it there, I went to github.com, logged in and went to my repositories, where I found my Gym project.
When I clicked into the "Gym" project, and Clicked on the Settings button, scrolled down to Github Pages, under Source I selected master branch.
The project then became available at the following link: https://siobhan008-stack.github.io/Gym/

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPLOYED AND DEVELOPMENT VERSION:
None

TO LOOK AT THE PROJECT USE THIS LINK:
https://f98105b5-737a-482b-9ce4-885c9fe42297.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/
In the bottom pane in the terminal window where it shows /workspace/gym if the webserver isn't started you can start the web server by typing python3 -m http.server
At the prompt which appears, click "Make Public" and then Open Browser, and the website will display in a new browser window.

MEDIA:
TEXT:
The text for the website was copied largely from this website:
https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/

IMAGES:
I used the logo from here: https://www.energiefitness.com/
In an effort to try to get some matching green gym images I googled images from the web and used them.
Other images were pulled from   https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/ and https://westwood.ie/
=>Some of the images are copyrighted but I just used it for this project as it matched web. 
Obviously for a live website I would not use these images

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I received inspiration for this project from gym websites and credit also to my mentor Jonathan Munz for much coding inspiration and enhancement ideas for my website.
Big thanks to the tutors also for assistance during the project and to Kevin as I had missed to include a script menu from one of my pages which was preventing the membership menu to function.
