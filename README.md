# Energie Gym Website

This is Energie gym's website where you can see the facilities on offer. We have a well equipped gym with many weights and training faciliites. There is also a 25m pool, sauna pool steam room and jacussi. 
You can find some images of our pool area, gym, sauna, pool and jacussi, along with some photos of the gym on our website too.
Our classes are available on our website along with detailed information. Note we offer Les Mills classes Body Balance, Body Pump, Body Combat and Body Attack. You can find a timetable of our classes on the website also.
Our website shows our location in Lucan, opening hours, contact details with social media links.
This is your chance to get fit, and become part of our team. As we say Energie gym is "where you belong".
Make some new friends at our classes or working out at the gym. 

## UX:
The website is for people of all ages. Anyone can join the gym and avail of all its features.
Whether that is classes, the gym or to relax in the pool sauna, jacussi, steam room. 
Its time to get fit, achieve that by joining our Engerie gym. As we say its where you belong :-).

## USER STORIES:
As a user I want an overview of the gym so I can see that by navigating to the Home menu at the top of the page. This provides an address, contact detail, opening hours, images and social media links
As a user I want to see the what types of classes are on offer, so I navigate to the Classes menu at the top which displays details on each.
As a user I want to find out more about the pool, so I navigate to the Pool menu at the top which displays details on the Pool along with pictures of the Sauna, Pool Jacussi and more images.
As a user I want to find out more about the classes timetable, so I navigate to the Timetable menu at the top which displays details on what classes are on at which times.
As a user I want to find out more about the gym, so I navigate to the Gym menu which displays information of what's available at the gym itself, weights etc along with some photos.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
You can find mockups of different screen images in the \assets\project directory

## Gym:
Home menu page (Index.html): This provides an address, contact detail, opening hours, images and social media links
Classes menu page (Classes.html). This  displays details on the classes we offer and descriptions of what each class is good for.
Pool menu page (Pool.html) At the top which displays details on the Pool along with pictures of the Sauna, Pool Jacussi and more images.
Timetable menu page (Timetable.html) This displays details on what classes are on at which times.
Membership menu page (Membership.html) This displays details on the various membership options and prices for each.

Note I purposely didn't keep a consisent design on the pool/gym /classes pages to showcase different placings of text and images.

## Future Features to be Implemented:
1. Add a download button on the timetable page so someone can have the schedule for the current month
2. Contact form to make it easier to contact us
3. Improve the responsiveness for different media
4. Add some videos 
5. Add some news articles.
6. Improve the membership page as per typical displays of prices on other gym websites

### Technologies used:
1. HTML & CSS programming languages
2. Bootstrap 4 and BootstrapCDN - To simplify the structure and make the website responsive.
3. Font Awesome - for social media icons
4. jQuery - for navbar
5. Gitpod - IDE for local development
6. Github - version control & repository
7. Github Pages - for deployment of the website
8. HTML Formatter - used to format HTML code

### Testing completed:
Home Page: 	Navigated to all the links off the top Menu and ensure that the relevant pages displayed correctly.
Membership Page: Navigated to all the links off the top Menu and ensure that the relevant pages displayed correctly.
Pool: Navigated to all the links off the top Menu and ensure that the relevant pages displayed correctly.

Timetable: Navigated to all the links off the top Menu and ensure that the relevant pages displayed correctly.
Checked the menu option on mobile brought me to all the correct pages.
Checked the responsiveness at all breakpoints and tried to improve as much as possible.

### Bugs:
There are some responsive display issues which I would like to fix but didn't have time.
The menu options could display better on a tablet.

## Deployment:
1. The website is hosted on Github Pages.
2. To deploy this project, I went to github.com, logged in and went to my repositories, where I found my Gym project.
3. When I clicked into the "Gym" project, and Clicked on the Settings button, scrolled down to Github Pages, under Source I selected master branch.
4. The project then became available at the following link: https://siobhan008-stack.github.io/Gym/

## Difference between deployed and development versions:
Should not be any differences.

## Links to my project:
https://f98105b5-737a-482b-9ce4-885c9fe42297.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/
In the bottom pane in the terminal window where it shows /workspace/gym if the webserver isn't started you can start the web server by typing python3 -m http.server
At the prompt which appears, click "Make Public" and then Open Browser, and the website will display in a new browser window.

### MEDIA:
#### Text:
The text for the website was copied largely from this website:
https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/

#### Images:
I used the logo from here: https://www.energiefitness.com/
In an effort to try to get some matching green gym images I googled images from the web and used them.
Other images were pulled from   https://www.clubvitae.com/liffeyvalley/ and https://westwood.ie/
=>Some of the images are copyrighted but I just used it for this project as it matched web. 
Obviously for a live website I would not use these images

### Acknowledgements:
1. I received inspiration for this project from gym websites.
2. Credit also to my mentor Jonathan Munz for much coding inspiration, review and enhancement ideas for my website.
3. Big thanks to the tutors also for assistance during the project and to Kevin as I had missed to include a script menu from one of my pages which was preventing the membership menu to function.
